VaccineNation: Backend for Vaccine Management System Technologies Used:

Spring Boot: Framework for building the backend application. Java: Programming language for writing the backend logic. Postman: Tool for testing and debugging API endpoints. DBeaver: Database management tool for interacting with the database. Description: VaccineNation is a backend system designed to manage the distribution and administration of vaccines efficiently. The system encompasses various functionalities to handle different aspects of vaccine management, including:

User Management:

Registration and authentication of users. Role-based access control for different user types (e.g., administrators, healthcare providers, and patients). Vaccine Inventory Management:

Tracking vaccine stock levels. Managing vaccine batches and expiration dates. Updating inventory upon receiving new vaccine shipments. Appointment Scheduling:

Allowing users to book vaccination appointments. Managing appointment slots and availability. Sending notifications for upcoming appointments. Vaccination Records:

Recording vaccination details for each patient. Generating and maintaining digital vaccination certificates. Providing a history of vaccinations for users. Reporting and Analytics:

Generating reports on vaccine usage and stock levels. Analyzing data to optimize vaccine distribution and reduce wastage. Monitoring vaccination rates and coverage. The backend is developed using Spring Boot, which simplifies the creation of robust and scalable RESTful APIs. Java is used to implement the business logic and handle various operations within the system. Postman is utilized for testing and validating the API endpoints, ensuring that the system functions as expected. DBeaver is employed for database management, allowing for efficient interaction with the underlying database.

This system aims to streamline the process of vaccine management, ensuring that vaccines are distributed and administered effectively, thereby contributing to public health efforts.
